13,3368,"<p>Aira caldera is located within Kagoshima Bay at the southern end of Kyushu in Japan. Sakurajima, an active andesitic stratovolcano, sits on the southern rim of the caldera. It is Japan&#8217;s most active volcano, often experiencing daily Vulcanian eruptions.<br />
Aira caldera, and Sakurajima in particular, are closely monitored by the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre &#8211; part of the University of Kyoto and Disaster Prevention Research Institute. Deformation has been recorded at Aira caldera since 1892 with campaign levelling surveys. This captured the 1m of subsidence associated with the 1914 Plinian eruption of Sakurajima. More recently, the volcano is continuously monitored with GPS, tiltmeters and strainmeters. These are supplemented with campaign GPS and levelling surveys, and sporadic InSAR acquisitions.<br />
The recent deformation patterns show a large-scale radial outwards bulge with continual inflation, centred within the caldera. Between 1996 and 2007, GPS results indicated a maximum inflation rate of ~1.5 cm/yr (<em>Iguchi</em>, 2013; <em>Hickey et al</em>., 2015). This has generally been interpreted as magma supply to a deep reservoir beneath the caldera, with an average magma supply rate of ~10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/yr (<em>Iguchi</em>, 2013; <em>Hickey et al</em>., 2015). The location of the deformation source is somewhat undefined. &#8216;Mogi&#8217; model results place it directly beneath the centre of the caldera at 8 &#8211; 11 km depth (<em>Iguchi</em>, 2013; <em>Pepe et al</em>., 2013), or alternatively slightly south of this beneath the northern edge of Sakurajima (<em>Yokoyama</em>, 2013). Finite Element model inversions accounting for topography and three-dimensional crustal mechanics as well as thermal effects indicate a large oblate shaped reservoir beneath the north-eastern quadrant of the caldera at a depth of 13 km (<em>Hickey et al</em>., 2015).<br />
Alterations to the general large scale inflation pattern are thought to be caused by a second, shallower (3 &#8211; 6 km) deformation source inferred as a short-term magma reservoir (<em>Iguchi</em>, 2013; <em>Pepe et al</em>., 2013), and/or magma flowing between the two sources (<em>Hidayati et al</em>., 2007; <em>Iguchi</em>, 2013; <em>Hickey et al</em>., 2015).<br />

16,949,"<p>During 1996 Akutan experienced a seismic swarm, and interferograms spanning June 1995 and September 1996 indicate ~60 cm of uplift on the western side of Akutan Island. This uplift is attributed to magma intrusion. On the northwest flank of the volcano, localised subsidence is observed in a region of intense ground cracking and extension. On the eastern half of the island, interferograms show broad subsidence comparable in magnitude to the uplift observed in the western part. This subsidence is coincident with thermal features and is thought to reflect depressurisation of the hydrothermal system as a result of the earthquake swarm. Displacements of ~5 cm are also observed on two normal faults that bound a graben on the southeast side of the island. This displacement suggests the island was in extension during the time of the earthquake swarm.<br />
This deformation episode is modelled using a four-source model including an expanding dike dipping at 75º with top depth 0.4 km, two contracting horizontal dislocation planes at depth 3.6 and 16.5 km, and a further steeply dipping contracting dislocation plane with top depth 6.7 km.<br />
Prior to and following the seismic swarm (1992 &#8211; 1995 and 1996 &#8211; 2002), the northwestern flank of Akutan was uplifted relative to the southwestern flank at ~1 cm/yr, whilst the region of ground cracking subsided by ~2 cm/yr following seismicity. This subsidence is thought to be caused by cooling and degassing of magma that was intruded in 1996.<br />
Uplift of the northwestern flank continued between 2004 and 2009 at ~1 cm/yr. This deformation is modelled at the same horizontal location as the dike source associated with the earthquake swarm but at a greater depth of 5 &#8211; 6.5 km and a shallower dip. This long term, steady uplift of the volcano is attributed to slow accumulation of magma.<br />
Interferograms also show persistent, time-varying subsidence within Akutan caldera at rates of 2 &#8211; 5 cm/yr. The source of this deformation is shallow (&lt;2 km depth) and is associated with the hydrothermal system.</p>

20,1679,"<p class=""p1"">From Anzidei et al., 2010: An uplift of ~30 cm over the last 43 years was recently detected by levelling surveys performed in the time span 1950-1993 along a levelling line that crosses the highest elevation area of the western flank of the volcano. The comparison between the 1950-1999 surveys show significant uplift, whereas the subsequent surveys (1997-1999 and 2002) have not shown uplift at a confidence level of 95%. From 2002 to 2006, a small uplift is detected along the leveling line and the Albano lake levelling circuit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Space-based GPS and InSAR observations confirm that this uplift is distributed in a wide area around the craters of Albano and Nemi, where the most recent volcanic activity occurred. GPS data from continuous monitoring stations indicate that both horizontal and vertical deformations do occur and that can be addressed to a shallow magmatic source.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The simplest model able to fit the low number of GPS observations (14 measurements from 6 GPS stations, 4 rejected due to local effects) is a point-pressure source at a depth of about 4.7 km, on the western flank of the Colli Albani complex.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A SAR dataset used to study the Colli Albani area is composed by ERS1 and ERS2 images, for a total of 66 SAR descending acquisitions available from June 1992 to December 2000, whilst 34 images from April 1993 until November 2000 concern the ascending dataset. An uplift zone, mainly located on the west part of the Colli Albani caldera complex is clearly evident.

If we assume a sim- ilar value for magma emplaced beneath Alcedo, between 0.6 and 10% of the magma would need to crystallize each year, to give the model distribution of volume reduction at 95% confidence. Note that the probability distribution for percentage of crystallization is less well constrained than that for volume reduction, as it also de- pends on the total volume which is not so well constrained. Cooling of the solidified magma could also contribute further to the volume reduction, with up to 2% contraction being the estimated value for solidified Krafla magma. Loss of volatiles from the magma chamber would reduce the pressure, also leading to a reduction in volume, but the pressure decrease required to produce the surface displacements

30,3239,"<p>In November 2008 an eruption occurred at the Alu-Dalafilla volcanoes, causing lava flows to extend to the NE. Pagli et al. (2012) showed that this eruption was sourced by a 1 km deep elongated magma chamber that exists in two segments, and was probably trigged by an influx of magma from the north. Both magma chamber segments appeared to source the eruption though a connecting dyke. The magma chambers have since, rapidly, refilled.<br />
InSAR was the primary tool to determine deformation during the eruption. Co-eruptive interferograms show an elongated, ~ 10-km-long, subsidence of 1.9<span class=""mb""><span class=""mb""> </span></span>m at the Alu volcano, and at Alu-South, maximum subsidence of 1<span class=""mb""><span class=""mb""> </span></span>m. From 5 November 2008 the deformation pattern at Alu-South reversed and uplift started, whereas at Alu minor subsidence continued between 5th November and 19th November but afterwards reversed to uplift. Since then, uplift occurred both at Alu and Alu-South. The maximum dyke opening to model this observation was 4.6<span class=""mb""><span class=""mb""> </span></span>m and the total dyke volume was 5.1×10<sup>6</sup><span class=""mb""><span class=""mb""> </span></span>m<sup>3. </sup>The observation of post-eruptive uplift is interpreted as the refilling of the source magma chamber.</p>

31,161,"<p>In the time that InSAR data has been available over Alutu (1997-2000, 2004-2010) two periods of uplift, followed by periods of gradual subsidence, have been observed (Biggs et al., 2011). The deformation throughout each period had a circular pattern, which was centred over the volcano. Firstly, 15 cm of uplift between December 2003 and August 2004 was observed. Gradual subsidence of 4.7 cm followed this, lasting 400 days, which could be fit by a simple exponential decay with a 200-300 day decay constant. The second phase of inflation (9.9 cm) was in July 2008 and lasted 150 days. In December 2008 this inflation ended, and gradual subsidence of 4.3 cm continued over the remaining 750 days of data. At this point the subsidence looked to continue. Throughout this period the magnitude of the inflation was greater than deflation, and so an overall inflation over this period is apparent. The time series of inflation and deflation show that these ground motions are not linear (Biggs et al., 2011).<br />
The deformation patterns at Alutu have been fit best by a penny shaped crack at a depth of 0.5-2.5 km, with a radius of 3-10 km. It has been suggested that the deformation can be explained by magma-driven uplift and hydrothermal field activity, and that the subsequent subsidence is associated with hydrothermal activity alone (Biggs et al., 2011).</p>

66,159,"<p>There is evidence from multiple methods that the western flank of Arenal is subsiding steadily at a rate of up to 10 cm/yr. Arenal stopped erupting in 2010 after almost 42 years of lava effusion, mostly on the volcano’s western side. Deformation is centred on these recent deposits. Measurements of subsidence at Arenal have been made for several decades, including dry tilt meter (1986-2000, Mora et al., 2013), Electronic Distance Meter (Avard et al., 2012) campaign GPS (Muller et al., in revision) and InSAR (2005-2010, Ebmeier et al., 2010). Long wavelength near-vertical subsidence (2-5 km diameter) has been attributed to elastic loading, consolidation of erupted material and basement subsidence. Higher rate deformation above elevations of ~800 m has a greater component of westward motion and is thought to be caused by multiple shallow, sliding units.</p>

Uplift in this region was then observed during 1999 – 2000, 2003 – 2004 and again in June 2006 continuing until the time of the last InSAR observations.<br />
The source of deformation is located on the western flank of Kliuchef. The source of uplift is located at 5 &#8211; 7 km depth. The rate of volume increase is seen to fluctuate and is superimposed upon a trend of steady increase at 0.005 km³/yr. Uplift is attributed to an intrusion of magma into a storage zone 5–8 km beneath the summit area. The source of subsidence is located 3 – 4 km below the surface, and is likely to be due to depressurisation caused by cooling and fluid loss from the uppermost part of the magma storage zone and/or the overlying hydrothermal system.</p>

EDM measurements at Augustine began in 1986, with campaign GPS surveys conducted in the early 1990s and 2000, and 5 continuous GPS stations established in 2004 by PBO. Campaign GPS data suggest subsidence between 1988 and 2000 of &lt;5 mm/yr, consistent with deflation of a source &lt; a few km beneath the volcano summit. The continuous GPS network then suggest uplift of 2 mm/month between June 2005 to January 2006 resulting from a shallow source. SBAS InSAR measurements between 1992 and 2005 also indicate steady, wholescale uplift of the volcano by 2–8 cm. This pre-eruptive deformation is modelled using two Mogi sources beneath the summit area. The shallower source (1.7 – 3.8 km depth) contracted at a rate of 0.2 x 10^6 m³/yr, whereas the deeper source (7–12 km depth) inflated at a rate of 2 x 10^6 m³/yr. InSAR observations also reveal subsidence of the 1986 pyroclastic flows on the north flank of Augustine. Finite element models of this subsidence indicate an initial excess temperature for the pyroclastic flow deposit of 640 °C and an average thickness of 9.3 m.

InSAR observations covering the 2005 &#8211; 2006 eruption reveal horizontal displacements of up to 20 mm, which is in agreement with continuous GPS measurements.

85,4053,"<p>Since the eruption in 1998, deformation at Axial Seamount has been monitored using bottom pressure recorders (BPRs) and mobile pressure recorders (MPRs).<br />
Between 1998 and 2004, the rate of inflation was highest in the months immediately after the eruption (20 cm/month) and has since declined to a steady rate of 15 cm/month. Uplift in the caldera has been observed at a rate of 22 cm/year relative to a point outside the caldera. Assuming continuous uplift since the 1998 eruption, these observations suggest that the centre of the caldera has re-inflated about 1.5 m, thus recovering almost 50% of the 3.2 m subsidence that was measured during the 1998 eruption. This inflation rate was used to calculate a magma supply rate of 14 x 10^6 m³/year. If this recurrence continues, it also suggests a recurrence interval of ~16 years between eruptions at Axial Seamount, assuming that it will be ready to erupt again when it has re-inflated to 1998 levels. (Chadwick et al., 2006).<br />
Data between 2004 to 2007 indicate steady inflation of 12.7 cm/year at the caldera centre. The spatial pattern of uplift is consistent with magma storage in a shallow reservoir underlying the caldera at a depth of 3.5 km, and the current uplift rate implies that magma is being supplied to the volcano at a rate of 7.5&#215;10^6 m³/year. However, the supply rate immediately after the eruption in 1998 was significantly higher, and the temporal pattern of uplift at Axial caldera appears to be governed by at least two processes occurring on very different time scales. The high uplift rates immediately following the 1998 eruption are interpreted to be due to either an influx from one or more small satellite magma bodies or as the result of viscoelastic relaxation and/or poroelastic behavior of the crust surrounding the shallow magma chamber. The current lower uplift rate is interpreted as being due to a steady long term magma supply from the mantle. This two component uplift pattern has not been observed on land volcanoes, suggesting that magma supply/storage processes beneath this ridge axis volcano differ from volcanoes on land (including Iceland). It is possible to forecast that the next eruption at Axial Seamount is likely to occur by about 2020, when most of the 3 m of deflation that occurred during the 1998 eruption will have been recovered. (Nooner et al., 2009).<br />
Continuous measurements of ocean bottom pressure document the deflation–inflation cycle of Axial Seamount between 1998 and 2011. The volcano inflation rate, caused by the intrusion of magma,  is found to have gradually increased in the months leading up to the 2011 eruption. Sudden uplift occurred 40–55 minutes before the onset of eruption, which is interpreted as a precursor event. Based on ground deformation measurements through the entire eruption cycle at Axial Seamount, it is suggested that another eruption could occur as early as 2018. It is proposed that the long-term eruptive cycle of Axial Seamount could be more predictable compared with its subaerial counterparts. This is because the volcano receives a relatively steady supply of magma through the Cobb hotspot and because it is located on thin oceanic crust at a spreading plate boundary. (Chadwick et al., 2012).</p>

<p id=""sp0005"">Grapenthin et al. (2012) investigate deformation related to ongoing activity and installed a GPS network of 8 continuous and 6 campaign stations around Bezymianny.</p>
<p>During the 2005–2010, the authors show: &#8220;(1) rapid and continuous network-wide subsidence between 8 and 12 mm/yr&#8221;, which appears to affect GPS stations more than 40 km away, which show 4–5 mm/yr of subsidence, &#8220;and (2) only the summit station BZ09 shows slight deviations from the average motion in the north component at times of eruptions&#8221;.</p>
<p id=""sp0010"">The authors model the deformation by &#8220;a deep sill at about 30 km under Kluchevskoy that constantly discharges material.&#8221; The sill is constrained by deep seismicity which suggests 9.5 km width, 12.7 km length, and a 13° dip-angle to the south-east.&#8221;  The authors infer a closing rate of 0.22 m/yr, which implies a volume loss of 0.027 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (0.16 m/yr and 0.019 km<sup>3</sup>/yr considering surface loading)&#8221;.</p>
<p id=""sp0015"">Eruption related deformation is likely due to &#8220;a very shallow reservoir, likely within Bezymianny&#8217;s edifice at a depth between 0.25 km and 1.5 km with a volume change of 1–4 × 10<sup>− 4</sup> km<sup>3</sup>. Much of the material erupted at Bezymianny may be sourced from deeper mid-crustal reservoirs with co-eruptive volume changes at or below the detection limit of the GPS network&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Pritchard and Simons present ERS-1 and -2 and RADARSAT data for northern Kamchatka between 1992 and 2003. The authors state that they &#8220;do not observe deformation associated with eruptions that occurred during the time period of observation at [&#8230;] Bezymianny, but because of the poor spatial and temporal coverage, only large signals would be detectable (see GSA Data Repository)&#8221;.</p>

143,167,"<p>InSAR data between 1997-2000 and 2004-2010 shows two periods of uplift, separated by a period subsidence (Biggs et al., 2011). The first period of uplift was in 2004, where ~3 cm was observed over ~3 months. After these 3 months some subsidence occurred, but until 2008 an absence of data prevents an accurate description of the exact changes throughout that time. Between August 2008 and June 2010 (900 days) a circular pattern of 5.3 cm of uplift was observed between Bora Berrichio and Tulla Moje volcano. The best fitting source model for this deformation was found to be a penny shaped crack between 0.9-1.3 km deep and 4.7-8.1 km radius (Biggs et al., 2011).<br />

The May 2000 and March 1999 eruptions were reportedly studied with InSAR using Radarsat-1 data, which apparently demonstrated clear deformation (Walter and Amelung, 2003). Walter and Amelung (2003) also report on numerical modelling of the interplay between the Cameroon fracture zones, and the size and orientation of feeding dyke(s).<br />

266,789,"<p>The first deformation measurements of Colima were made with annual levelling surveys, and were complemented with GPS stations installed in the mid 1990&#8217;s (<em>Murray &amp; Wooler, 2002</em>). They recorded a persistent subsidence at a rate of 5 mm/year, 1.1 km from the summit (levelling), and 93 mm/yr at the edge of the dome (GPS). The GPS also recorded horizontal displacements at a maximum rate of 23 mm/year near the dome. Simple deformation models were unable to fit the observations, and the deformation was thought to most likely be due to a combination of downslope creep, settling and compaction of the edifice, and gravitational spreading (<em>Murray &amp; Wooler, 2002</em>).<br />
EDM surveys conducted between May 1997 and Jan 1999 detected up to 4 m shortening at an accelerating rate peaking at 90 cm shortening from Oct-Nov 1998 before lava extrusion began on 20th Nov 1998 (<em>Ramı́rez-Ruiz et al., 2002</em>). The pre-eruption inflation was assumed to be caused by magma accumulating in the edifice.<br />
Monitoring of tilt signals at Colima showed inflation between lava extrusion in Oct. 2004 and Vulcanian explosions in Feb. 2005, followed by subsidence in May &#8211; June 2005 (<em>Zobin et al., 2011</em>). Two magmatic sources were modelled for the deformation &#8211; one at 300-1800 m depth for the earlier inflation and one at 1800-2800 m depth for the later subsidence. The tiltmeters also recorded rapid inflation-deflation signals, caused by impulses from Vulcanian explosions in 2005, and with amplitudes correlated to the size of explosions recorded by seismometers.<br />
Early InSAR studies of Colima did not observe any deformation between 2002-2010 most likely due to steep slopes, atmospheric noise and temporal aliasing (<em>Pinel et al., 2011</em> and <em>Chaussard el al., 2013</em>, see <a href=""http://vccw.test/volcano/popocatepetl/"">Popocatepetl</a> entry for full references). Spotlight TerraSAR-X imagery acquired 19 and 7 hours before an explosion on Jan 6th 2013 show up to 5 cm of pre eruptive deformation near the dome (<em>Salzer et al., 2014</em>). Modelling of this deformation is best fit by two shallow elliptical sources pressurising by 22-25 MPa. One source is at 150-300 m below the summit and the other only 10&#8217;s of meters below the summit within the lava dome.<br />
Direct measurements of the dome have recently been feasible using pixel offset tracking of thermal infrared imagery. Cross-correlation of pixels from imagery in Feb 2011 records permanent dome growth of up to 0.3 m within 120 s, coincident with volcanic emissions (<em>Walter et al., 2013</em>).</p>

269,4327,"<p>Copahue is a southern Andes volcano that has been inflating since early 2012, with intermittent summit eruptive activity since late 2012. We have an extensive InSAR time series from RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed data, although both are from descending tracks. Preliminary modeling suggests a very irregular magma body that extends from the volcanic edifice to less than 5 km depth and located slightly north of the summit at shallow depths but to the ENE at greater depths. Ref 1<br />
A deformation rate of approximately 2 cm/yr was calculated, located mostly on the north-eastern flank of Copahue volcano, and assumed to be constant during the period of the interferograms. Results from inverse modelling indicate that a source located beneath the volcano edifice at a mean depth of 4 km is producing a volume change of approximately 0.0015 km/yr.  Ref 2<br />
The models for the 2 interferograms indicate a relatively constant contraction rate of about 0.001 km<sup>3</sup>/yr. The shallow depth of the source, 4 km, is consistent with the expected depth of hydrothermal activity. Ref 3.</p>

271,163,"<p>There is evidence for several periods of uplift and subsidence at Corbetti since 1994, all in a circular pattern centred on the volcano, measured by InSAR (Biggs et al., 2011). Between 1994 and 1996 uplift of 1.4cm was observed. Then between 23 September 1997 &#8211; 13 September 2000 a minimum of 14 cm subsidence (incoherence prevents determination of upper bound). Uplift is then observed again in 2009, but lack of data constrains how this develops through time. Between these periods of activity no ground motion is observed where data is available.<br />
The 1997-2000 deformation can be described by point source at a depth of 5.8-7.8 km (to 1 sigma). Comparison of the temporal evolution at Corbetti to Campi Flegrei (Italy) has lead to suggestions that the volcanic processed are independent of the regional stress regime (Biggs et al., 2011).<br />
Inside Corbetti Caldera there are also two peaks (Urji to the west, and Chabi east). The 1997-2000 uplift is centred on Chabi, and the 2009-2010 subsidence is centred between the two peaks.<br />

Waveform modelling of VLP earthquakes during this period gave a source location to the north of the summit, which has been attributed to both magmatic and hydrothermal activity (<em>Molina et al., 2008</em>; <em>Hickey et al., 2015</em>).<br />
No deformation was detected at Cotopaxi between 2006 and 2008 during an ALOS survey of Latin American volcanoes (<em>Fournier et al., 2010</em>).<br />

293,1376,"<p>In 2005 a 60 km dyke, with 8 m opening, connecting  the Manda Hararo and Dabbahu regions occured (Wright et al. 2012). Following the 2005 dyke intrusion 12 more dykes occured at Manda Hararo, and are discussed seperately on the Manda Hararo page.  Wright et al. (2006) report that magma was injected along the 2005 dyke between depths of 2 and 9 km, corresponding to a total intrusion volume of <img style=""border: 0; vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.nature.com/__chars/math/special/sim/black/med/base/glyph.gif"" alt=""approx"" />2.5 km<sup>3</sup>. Wright et al. (2006) also present a 3D deformation field for the Dabbahu rifting episode derived from satellite radar data. The deformation field showsthat the entire segment ruptured, making it the largest to have occurred on land in the era of satellite geodesy. They report that much of the magma appears to have originated from shallow chambers beneath Dabbahu and Gabho volcanoes to the north, where an explosive fissural eruption occurred on 26 September 2005.<br />
Gradin et al. (2009) provides an alternative InSAR study. They report on the geometry of the dike and neighboring magma chambers and perform an inversion for the distribution of opening of the dike, as well as slip on rift border faults. Above the dike the find faults slip by an average 3 m, yielding an estimated geodetic moment of 3.5 × 10<sup>19</sup> Nm. The conclude that Dabbahu was two-stage intrusion, whereby rifting in the northern Manda Hararo Rift was triggered by magma upwelling in the Dabbahu area, at the northern extremity of the magmatic segment.<br />
One study (Hamling et al. 2009), using InSAR and GPS, report no subsidence at either of the volcanoes at the northern end of the segment, which partly fed the 2005 September dyke, during the 2007 5 km dyke. Pagli et al. (2014) have also looked at the 2007 dyke intrusion. Their results agree with the other studies.</p>

The survey did note a somewhat unusual positive inflation signal amounting to roughly 4cm during the relevant time period; however, most of this displacement occurred in a &#8216;spike&#8217; between May 2008 and September 2009. Prior to this, very little deformation was observed at the volcano. Due to the ambiguity of the signal, the authors could not confidently attribute the uplift to a particular cause &#8211; it is worth noting, however, that a series of phreatic explosions did occur at the volcanic complex in January 2009, so it is possible that a hydrothermal source was responsible for the displacement.</p>

Fixing the depth to that of local seismicity (7 km) yields an average rate of volume change of ~0.004 km³/year. Deformation is attributed to magmatic intrusion (possibly episodic), or isostatic rebound as the ice cap thins and recedes.<span style=""color: rgb(0.000000%, 0.000000%, 100.000000%);""> </span></p>

This activity, ongoing since at least 1972, has led to the establishment of the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory (MEVO) with research undertaken primarily by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.

There was a reversal of direction in 2004, otherwise no other significant transient deformation was observed, except for 10-20 mm annual variations in the vertical at several stations (Murray et al., 2006). The motions are consistent with a shallow magma chamber source. The reversal in the direction of motion coincides with a change in Strombolian activity (Murray et al., 2006). </span></p>

418,4114,"<p>Cycles of inflation and deflation were detected by a tiltmeter installed 2.5 km from the lava dome of Guagua Pichincha between September and December 1999 (Garcia-Aristizabal et al., 2007). The tilt signals were temporally correlated with VT and LP earthquake swarms, and the largest tilt change of 26 μrad corresponded with the growth of a small lava dome (0.5 million m<sup>3</sup>) between 18 to 21 November 1999. The inflation was followed by deflation on the 26 November 1999 when the lava dome collapse, suggesting the inflation was due to pressure build-up by the dome blocking the conduit (Garcia-Aristizabal et al., 2007).<br />
A regional ALOS survey of Northern Andes volcanoes found the west flank of Guagua Pichincha to be inflating at a rate of 2.6 ± 0.5 cm/yr between 2007 and 2009 (Morales Rivera et al., 2016).

568,3616,"<p>Kerinci was covered by Chaussard &amp; Amelung&#8217;s survey of west Sunda volcanoes, using ALOS InSAR data. This study covered a surface area of approximately 400,000km<sup>2</sup> between mid-2006 and mid-2009. At Kerinci, the researchers noted significant uplift, with an average rate of 7.7 cm/yr, though this increased in a roughly linear trend during the study period. The uplift was typically centred around the summit of the edifice. The rate of uplift reached a maximum of 10 cm/yr between 2008 and 2009, shortly preceding a series of small eruptions at the volcano, which led the authors to draw a connection between the two events. Chaussard &amp; Amelung suggest a shallow magmatic source to be responsible for the deformation, which their models estimate to be at a depth of 0.7 km below sea level (4.1 km below the summit).</p>

579,1057,"<p>Between 1999 &#8211; 2000, Kiska volcano subsided by up to 7 cm (volume decrease 0.00003 km³). Interferograms spanning 2000 &#8211; 2001 suggest that subsidence continued but at a lower rate (maxmimum displacements ~2 cm). During 2004 &#8211; 2005, no deformation occured, but in 2005 &#8211; 2006 the summit area of the volcano uplifted by 3 &#8211; 4 cm (volume increase 0.00001 km³). The volcano then again subsided between 2006 &#8211; 2008 by ~3 cm (volume decrease 0.000005 km³). Overall these observations suggest that during times of quiescence, Kiska alternately uplifts and subsided, with a subsidence prevailing in the long term.<br />
Deformation at Kiska volcano is modelled as a point source. This source is located 0.7 &#8211; 1 km below the summit, which suggests that deformation occurs due to pressure changes in the shallow hydrothermal system within the edifice. Uplift occurs when there is a heat flux into the self-sealed reservoir, increasing pore fluid pressure. Subsidence occurs when there is failure of the reservoir.</p>

Kliuchef showed a small amount of localised subsidence during 1997–1998, 1998–1999, and 2004 – 2005. Uplift in this region was then observed during 1999 – 2000, 2003 – 2004 and again in June 2006 continuing until the time of the last InSAR observations.<br />
The source of deformation is located on the western flank of Kliuchef and Korovin lies on the edge of the deforming area. The source of uplift is located at 5 &#8211; 7 km depth. The rate of volume increase is seen to fluctuate and is superimposed upon a trend of steady increase at 0.005 km³/yr. Uplift is attributed to an intrusion of magma into a storage zone 5–8 km beneath the summit area. The source of subsidence is located 3 – 4 km below the surface, and is likely to be due to depressurisation caused by cooling and fluid loss from the uppermost part of the magma storage zone and/or the overlying hydrothermal system.<br />

598,3885,"<p>As might be expected from an active volcano of such notoriety, the activity at Krakatau is heavily monitored. A key study of deformation at the volcano was performed by Agustan et al; this study covered a period of almost two years, centred around the eruption which occurred between October 2007 and August 2008. Agustan&#8217;s observations utilised PALSAR data from the Japanese ALOS satellite, and uncovered a complex pattern of deformation both prior to and immediately following the eruption.<br />
Before the onset of explosive activity at the volcano, the edifice experienced a net inflation of up to 4cm, though there was subsidence around the crater rim up to 3 months prior to the eruption. The estimated total volume increase was approximately 1&#215;10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, and this period of deformation is widely believed to have been caused by magmatic activity which eventually led to the October eruptions.<br />
After August 2008, the volcano displayed an uneven and unusual pattern of deformation; the south-western side of the edifice subsided by roughly 18cm, while the north-eastern side uplifted by almost 12cm. Following numerical simulations. Agustan et al attributed this to the tensile opening of a fault below the edifice, at a depth of approximately 400m below sea level.<br />
The Krakatoa Monitoring System (Krakmon) has recently (2007) installed a series of three GPS stations at locations on the volcano itself, though no observations have yet been published at the time of writing.</p>

The authors show that uplift &#8220;continued until fall of 2009 when the area began to subside reaching the pre-inflation state in early spring 2010. In April 2010 another uplift episode started&#8221;. Up to 2011, the inflation continued at a comparable deformation rate to the pre-deflation one.<br />
In 2011, the Krísuvík area was monitored with continuous and campaign GPS measurements and InSAR. The deformation registered by the GPS stations suggests an inflation source at 4-5 km depth located beneath Sveifluháls area, with uplift rates exceeding 50 mm/yr at stations closest to the inflation center, just north of Seltún geothermal area. TerraSAR-X data indicate the extent of the uplift.<br />
Seismic activity in the Krísuvík area over two years (~2009-2011?) indicate more frequent earthquakes during the inflation periods while fewer during the deflating phase. The authors show that the earthquakes lineate a N-S trending structure and coseismic GPS displacements suggest right lateral rupture on a N-S trending strike-slip fault.<br />

619,1235,"<p>An EDM/GPS network was set up in 1994. Over three campaigns (spanning 1994 to 1997), no significant deformation was identified on the western flank of Cumbre Vieja (the last volcanic expression of a succession of growing and overlapping volcanic centers in La Palma). However, the area was limited to a fault previously active in 1949 (<span id=""bbb0315"">Moss et al., 1999</span>).<br />
In 2006, a GPS network of 26 stations was installed over the entire La Palma Island and revisited in 2006, 2007 and 2008; the 1994 sites were also included in this network. Significant ground deformation at Teneguia volcano (the area of the last eruption in 1971) was measured (<span id=""bbb0345"">Prieto et al., 2009</span>). The results indicate linear velocities of subsidence between 4 and 9 mm/year, with the greatest amount of deformation on the western flank. A thermal source is interpreted as the most probable origin for deformation. These results agreed with InSAR results (Perlock et al., 2008).<br />
InSAR data between 1992 and 2008 indicate movement on the western flank of Cumbre Vieja. González et al. (2010) interpret the deformation as shallow slip of a near-horizontal dislocation beneath the western flank, due to creeping stress release due to gravitational loading in the most recent inter-eruptive period.<br />

The different snow and ice types on a glacier may be subdivided according to the glacier-facies concept. The surticial expression of some facies may be detected at the end ofthe balance year by the use ofvisible and near-infrared image data from the Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) and thematic mapper (TM) sensors (Williams et al., 1991)<br />
The construction of digital elevation models (DEMs) of glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets is an important application of remote sensing in glaciology. DEMs are used to determine mass balance via volume change (Haeberli et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">1999</span>; Krabill et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">1999</span>; Barrand et al.,), to delineate catchments of ice and water flow (Elvehøy, et al., 2009), and as inputs to hydrology and ice flow models (e.g. Kääb and Funk <span class=""ref-lnk"">1999</span>; Hubbard et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">2000 </span>; Arnold et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">2006b</span>; Joughin et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">2009</span>). Remote-sensing technologies have been a boon to this field, reducing the effort needed for fieldwork and extending coverage to previously inaccessible locations. Satellite radar and laser altimetry have been particularly useful, because the techniques measure surface elevation directly (Bamber and Rivera <span class=""ref-lnk"">2007)</span>. Although satellite altimetry is highly accurate over large areas, its relatively low spatial resolution means it can only be used at the scale of large glaciated regions, ice caps, and ice sheets (Rignot et al., 2003; Zwally et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">2005</span>; Pritchard et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">2009</span>; Moholdt et al. <span class=""ref-lnk"">2010</span>). For this reason, higher resolution multispectral satellite imagery or airborne data are often used for studying smaller ice caps and mountain glaciers (Pope et al., 2013).

668,1224,"<p class=""p1"">In the last ~35 years, over 75 cm of uplift has been observed at Long Valley Caldera at an average rate of 3 cm/yr. Deformation within the caldera is dominated by episodic, symmetrical inflation of the resurgent dome, with no periods of subsidence. Uplift occurred in 1978-1983, 1990-1995, 1996, and 1997-1998. This ground deformation has been monitored using an array of ground based instruments including 46 GPS receivers and 9 tiltmeters that make up the network monitoring Long Valley Caldera (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/gps/LongValley/). Tiltmeters were installed in the e<span style=""color: #333333;"">arly 1980s, with additional instruments added in 2009.

Between 1992 &#8211; 2000, uplift of 5–10 mm/yr was observed, and inspection of individual interferograms suggests that most deformation occurred during 1997–2000. Between 2000 &#8211; 2004, averaged deformation images show that the inflation near Martin, Mageik and Trident continued at 4–7 mm/year, slightly lower than the results for 1997–2000. This inflation has been modelled using a spheroid and sill source to account for the elongate shape of the deformation field. The source location is constrained to the summit and eastern flank of Mageik, with dimensions ranging between 10 &#8211; 20 km and depths ranging from 5 &#8211; 15 km. The average rate of volume increase since 1995 is 0.008 km³/yr. The inflation pattern is consistent with gravity surveys of the area which reveal a low density gravity anomaly in the region. These observations suggest the presence of a crustal magma body that is probably responsible for the inflation signal.</p>

689,5217,"<p>Between October 1993 and September 1995, interferograms show ~7 cm of uplift of Makushin volcano. This uplift is modelled using a point source located ~7 km beneath the volcano&#8217;s eastern flank, with a volume increase of 0.022 km³. Uplift is thought to be due to the accummulation of magma prior to an eruption of the volcano in January 1995. Interferograms spanning 1995 &#8211; 2000 and 2004 &#8211; 2009 subsidence of ~1 cm/yr. This subsidence is modelled by a source located at the same horizontal position and depth as that for preeruptive uplift. This suggests that subsidence could be caused by cooling and volatile loss from recently intruded magma. Other possible explanations include reduction of pore fluid pressure due to cooling and volatile loss from the hydrothermal system, or migration of magma/magmatic fluid to another reservoir.</p>

698,1373,"<p>Manda Hararo sits within the faulted and fissured Karhabi graben. In 2009 a field observations, undertaken following a measurement of high SO2 from the area, identified a&#8217;a basalt flows originating from 4-5 km fissures. The earliest dyke intrusion recorded geodetically date from 2005. InSAR studies (Gradin et al. 2010a) report seperate 13 dyke intrusions between 2005 and 2009. Kinematic inversions from Gradin et al. (2010a) of InSAR data reveal that dikes, at an average 5 km depth, opened by 0.8–3.5 m throughout this time. It is estimated each have volumes of 0.04–0.2 km<sup>3</sup>. The September 2005 megadyke had a length of 60 km (Hamling et al. 2014), 12 m opening and a volume greater than 1 km<sup>3</sup> (Gradin et al. 2010a). See Gradin et al. (2010b) Figure 1 for timeline of dyke intrusions 2005 &#8211; 2009.<br />
Other studies of the same 2005 &#8211; 2009 dyke intrusions (Gradin et al. 2010b) have shown that transient deformation occurs in the inter-diking periods. Gradin et al. (2010b) were able to describe the deformation by the presence of seven inflating or deflating pressure sources. In addition, Gradin et al. 2010 identifies sustained deflation of a deep magma reservoir at Dabbahu in the 6 months following the main rifting event of 2005, and slow decelerating post-eruptive re-inflation of two shallow magma reservoirs below Dabbahu and Gabho volcanoes.<br />
A detailed study of the 2005 dyking event can be found in Gradin et al. (2009), who report a dyke volume of 1.5–2.0 km<sup>3</sup>, and slip on faults above the dyke of 3 m. For details on post-dyking deformation see Hamling et al. (2014).</p>

708,5207,"<p>Broad deformation observed at Martin also covers the vicinity of Trident and Mageik. Between 1992 &#8211; 2000, uplift of 5–10 mm/yr was observed, and inspection of individual interferograms suggests that most deformation occurred during 1997–2000. Between 2000 &#8211; 2004, averaged deformation images show that the inflation near Martin, Mageik and Trident continued at 4–7 mm/year, slightly lower than the results for 1997–2000. This inflation has been modelled using a spheroid and sill source to account for the elongate shape of the deformation field. The source location is constrained to the summit and eastern flank of Mageik, with dimensions ranging between 10 &#8211; 20 km and depths ranging from 5 &#8211; 15 km. The average rate of volume increase since 1995 is 0.008 km³/yr. The inflation pattern is consistent with gravity surveys of the area which reveal a low density gravity anomaly in the region. These observations suggest the presence of a crustal magma body that is probably responsible for the inflation signal.</p>

716,4014,"<p>Mauna Loa is currently in its longest period of repose in the last 200 years, with its last eruption occurring in 1984. However there was an observed increase in seismicity beginning in March 2013 with a slow inflation starting in early 2014. As of July 2014, InSAR and GPS data indicate subtle inflationary deformation, although inflation rates are a lot less than those observed before and after the 1984 eruption. These rates are also far less than during the 2002-2009 unrest. (Thelen et al., 2014).<br />
The inflation is consistent with pressurisation of the known 3-5 km deep magma storage area beneath Mauna Loa&#8217;s caldera.  (Thelen et al., 2014).<br />
InSAR studies covering the period between 2002 and 2005 suggest a  depth to the magma chamber of 4.7 km below the summit, with a radius of 1.1 km, and a dike intrusion at 4-8 km depth and 8 km length. (La Marra et al., 2015).<br />
The summit area of Mauna Loa has undergone a long term inflation between 2003 and 2014, with a peak of about 8 cm of vertical deformation between mid-2004 and mid-2005, especially on the summit. Part of this deformation may be related to the instability of the flank. La Marra et al. (2015) identified several distinct periods with linear deformation behavior. (La Marra et al., 2015).</p>

In order to constrain horizontal displacements at the volcano, campaign GPS surveys were carried out in <span style=""color: #2e2e2e;"">1996, 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2004. These measurements show that vertical displacements are ~3 times larger than horizontal displacements (Poland et al. 2006). InSAR measurements made between 1993 &#8211; 2000 support the observation of subsidence at a rate of ~ 1 cm/yr. </span><br />
<span style=""color: #2e2e2e;""><span style=""color: #333333;"">In 2005-2006 3 GPS receivers were installed to make up the continuous monitoring network at Medicine Lake </span>(CalVO website) (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/gps/NCalifornia/). Further InSAR measurements </span>spanning 2003 &#8211; 2011 show that deformation continues at a constant rate (Parker et al. 2014).<br />
The best fitting analytical models to all datasets suggest that the source is a horizontal sill located at 9 &#8211; 11 km depth, although whether this circular or tabular is not constrained. The rate of volume change is inferred to be -0.001 &#8211; -0.003 km³/yr. The exact cause of deformation is uncertain, but is suggested to be a combination of tectonic extension, gravitational loading, plus volume loss at depth, most likely due to cooling and crystallisation of cooling magma.<br />

No deformation was detected at Nevado del Ruiz between 2006 and 2009 during ALOS surveys of Latin American volcanoes (<em>Fournier et al</em>., 2010, <em>Parks et al</em>., 2011). An ALOS interferogram from Jan. 2008 to Mar 2011 also did not find any deformation (detection threshold &lt; 1 cm/year) (<em>Lundgren et al</em>., 2015).<br />
Radarsat 2 interferograms between Dec. 2011 and Dec 2014 show inflation at a maximum linear rate of 3-4 cm/year, centred ~15 km south of Nevado del Ruiz (<em>Lundgren et al</em>., 2015). The deformation was modelled by an inflating mogi and spheroidal source at 14 km depth. Continuous GPS installed in 2010 also detected ~6 cm of inflation at Nevado del Ruiz during 2012 (Ordoñez et al., 2015).</p>

Gottsmann et al. (2007) reported joint and simultaneous continuous multiparameter observations at the restless Nisyros caldera, which reveal non-steady short-term oscillatory signals. The combined geodetic, gravimetric, seismic and electromagnetic records indicate that the oscillations are associated with thermohydromechanical disturbances of the hydrothermal system. The dominant period of oscillation (40 – 60 min) indicates short-term processes most likely associated with instabilities in the degassing process. Amplitudes of recorded geodetic and gravimetric signals are comparable to amplitudes observed at other periodically restless calderas. Gottsmann et al. (2007) concludes that shallow aqueous fluid migration can contribute significantly to periodic unrest, explaining the lack of eruptions in many cases of unrest.</p>

813,2037,"<p>Nyiragongo is a stratovolcano, and one of the worlds only volcanoes with a persistent lava lake. Several eruptions have been recorded in recent times at this volcano, including at least 18 between 1884-2001.<br />
In January 2002 an eruption occurred along a 20 km fracture network that extended south of the volcano. Using ERS-2 and RADARSAT-1 Wauthier et al. (2012) identified that the eruption involved a 3 km deep (6 x 40 km long), and a shallower 2 km thick, pair of dykes. It is thought that magma fed the deeper dyke over the previous 10 months, which caused then fed the shallower, eruptive, dyke. Measurements of the surface of Lake Kivu suggest that 70-80 cm of subsidence occurred at Goma Harbour in the month that followed the eruption (Tedesco et al., 2007).<br />
Since May 2002 there has been continued activity at Nyiragongo. Between 1996 and 2010 Toombs and Wadge (2012) have identified using InSAR 7 periods where the deformation could be described by shallow near-vertical dykes, which go on to feed eruptive fissures. They also note that between eruptions, the caldera summit and the NNW trending fissure zone subsides &lt; 3-5 cm/yr.  In the 6 months prior to the 2010 eruption a 10-km wide zone centred on the caldera inflated by 1–2 cm. Toombs and Wadge (2012) attribute this deformation to the compression of a magma chamber which is 3-8 km deep.</p>

819,5219,"<p>The center of Okmok caldera uplifted &gt;14 cm during 1992–1993 and ~6 cm during 1993–1995. The caldera then subsided 1 &#8211; 2 cm in 1995 &#8211; 1996 prior to the start of an eruption in 1997. During this eruption the caldera subsided more than 1.2 m. Prior to the 1997 eruption, the source volume increased by ~0.006 km³. During the 1997 eruption the volume decrease was ~0.047 km³.<br />
Soon after the 1997 eruption the volcano re-inflated at rates decreasing from ~10 cm/yr in 1997 &#8211; 1998 to ~4 cm/yr in 2000 &#8211; 2001. The inflation rate increased again in 2001 &#8211; 2003 reaching a maximum of ~20 cm/yr before slowing to 10 cm/yr in 2003 &#8211; 2004. Between 2004 &#8211; 2005 the caldera floor subsided 3 &#8211; 5 cm, before uplifting a similar amount during 2005 &#8211; 2006. Between the summers of 2007 and 2008, an additional 15 cm of uplift occured prior to another eruption in July 2008.  It is estimated that 0.037 &#8211; 0.052 km³ of magma accumulated beneath Okmok between the 1997 and 2008 eruptions, with variations in the deformation rate attributed to variable rates of magma accumulation beneath the caldera.<br />
During the 2008 eruption of Okmok the volcano again experienced volcano-wide subsidence. The caldera floor also experienced localised subsidence of over 1 m including ~75 cm of deformation that occurred during the first 13 hours of the eruption. This localised subsidence of the caldera floor is modelled using a collapsing tabular source located at 0.5 km depth with a volume decrease of 0.005 km³. This source may reflect a loss of groundwater, which interacted with rising magma.<br />
The source of deformation at Okmok is modelled as a spherical zone of shallow (~3 km depth) magma storage with radius ~1 km located beneath the caldera.  This source has uplifted as magma accumulates and deflated rapidly as material is erupted. It has also deflated at a lower rate between eruptions. This slow rate of subsidence is attributed to degassing of magma as it cools and crystallises.<br />
Residual fringes in interferograms prior to both eruptions are attributed to cooling and compaction of lavas, with the largest subsidence rates (~1.5 cm/yr) occurring at the thickest parts of the flows.</p>

822,3242,"<p>Ol Doinyo Lengai is an unusual volcano given its eruptive product are natrocarbonatitic. Ol Doinyo Lengai is often erupting, and has done so since 1983. Most eruptions are small lava flows, pools and spatter cones (hornitos) confined to the summit crater.<br />
In 2007 (July &#8211; August) a larger eruption, described as a rifting episode, occurred. This event was studied using InSAR by Biggs et al. (2009). The eruption began with subsidence that was attributed to ∼40 cm of normal motion on a NE striking fault to the south of the volcano. However, from 17th July deformation was dominated by the intrusion of ∼7-km-long dyke. Dyke opening increased gradually to a total of ∼2.4 m. From July 21, the collapse of a shallow graben above the fault dominated the near-field displacements.<br />
A similar study by Baer et al. (2008) concluded the same sequence of events: attributing deformation to normal faulting in the first week of the event, followed by intermittent episodes of dike propagation, oblique dike opening and dike-induced faulting. They report a gradual decline in the intensity of deformation occurred over the final weeks.</p>

837,5242,"<p>Campaign levelling surveys at Pacaya in 1979 and 1980 recorded up to 196 mm of deflation over 6 months, followed by 19 mm of inflation, again over 6 months (<em>Eggers, 1983</em>). Combining the deformation measurements with gravity surveys leads to the conclusion that the deformation is caused by the movement of magma beneath the volcano.<br />
No deformation was detected at Pacaya (detection threshold 3 cm/yr) during an ALOS survey of Central American volcanoes (<em>Ebmeier et al., 2013</em>).<br />
UAVSAR surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 detect up to 2 m of ground motion at Pacaya. A two week UAVSAR interferogram suggests that the deformation is due to slope instability (Lundgren., 2013</p>

849,3935,"<p>Papandayan is fortunate enough to be the site of a large and well-established network of seven GPS stations, and campaign surveys monitoring deformation of the volcano first began in 1998, carried out by the Department of Geodetic Engineering, Institute of Technology, Bandung. A 2006 paper by Abidin et al summarises seven such surveys over a period of five years, including the recent eruption which occurred November-December 2002.<br />
During &#8216;normal&#8217; periods of activity at the site (i.e. before the eruption), the ground deformation observed at the site was minimal, typically on the order of several millimetres to 1-2cm per year, though in the year prior to the eruption a larger signal of horizontal expansion was noted across the volcanic crater. In the months leading up to the November 2002 explosion, &#8216;significant&#8217; inflation of tens of centimetres was observed around the crater, with the largest displacement of 30cm occurring at station DPN0, 500m from the vent.<br />
During the eruption itself, deformation on the edifice was considerably more erratic; conflicting signals of inflation and deflation were observed at adjacent stations, sometimes changing within the space of a single day. The authors attribute this to a fluctuating pressure source at depth, with inflation being linked to a relatively shallower source and vice versa; however, as data could only be safely collected from two stations during this period, this hypothesis could not be verified.<br />
Following the eruption, a comparison of readings taken between August 2002 and June 2003 showed a general inflation of the site of between 10-20cm, with the majority of the displacement being focused around the crater site.</p>

There have been no observations of long term deformation of Popocatépetl above background tectonic rates in the GPS network, although there may be some small short period transient signals (<em>Cabrol-Cano et al., 2008</em>). This has been supported by InSAR studies, which have also failed to detect deformation at a rate greater than 0.5 cm/year (<em>Pinel et al., 2011, Chaussard et al., 2013</em>).<br />
The conclusion from published deformation studies is that the current eruptive phase of Popocatépetl is supplied by a network of deep rooted conduits rather than a shallow magma chamber. The volcano is thought to behave as a semi-open system, such that significant pressure build up does not occur (<em>Cabrol-Cano et al., 2008</em>).</p>

908,4331,"<p>Varying deformation was observed at Cordón Caulle, between 1996 and 2008 (Fournier et al., 2010). Between 2008 and 2011, there were 3 episodes of pre-eruptive uplift with a cumulative maximum uplift of 30 cm (Jay et al., 2014).<br />
The 2011-2012 eruption of Puyehue-Cordón Caulle lasted 9 months and was accompanied by coeruptive subsidence of ~1.2 m at Cordillera Nevada caldera and 0.4 m at Puyehue volcano, during the first three eruption days. Subsequent subsidence of ~2 m was observed at the southern part of the graben during the rest of the eruption (Jay et al., 2014).<br />
Following the eruption, between March 2012 and May 2015, the volcano re-inflated by up to 0.8 m with a maximum rate of up to 45 cm/yr (Delgado et al., 2016). Both subsidence and uplift can be modelled by addition or removal of magma in reservoirs at 5-10 km depth (Jay et al 2014, Delgado et al 2016).<br />
Comparison of pre- and post-eruptive digital terrain models suggest that the 2011-2012 eruption was accompanied by the intrusion of a shallow (20-200 m depth) batholith with a volume of 0.8 km<sup>3</sup> that locally uplifted the ground surface by up to 200 m  (Castro et al., 2016)</p>

930,713,"<p>A campaign GPS network of 14 benchmarks was established at Redoubt in 1991 and reoccupied in 2001, 2008, 2009, and 2010. The first CGPS station was installed by the PBO 28 km NE of Redoubt in 2006. This station recorded subtle motion radially outward from the volcano from early May 2008, which then reversed with the onset of explosive activity in 2009. In response to unrest at Redoubt, the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Volcano Observatory converted 4 of the campaign GPS sites to temporary CGPS stations during early 2009 prior to the first magmatic eruption. GPS observations are split into time intervals reflecting changes in eruptive behaviour:<br />
(1) inter-eruptive period (June 2001–August 2008) &#8211; no clear deformation signal until May<br />
(2) precursory phase (August 2008–March 2009)  &#8211; subtle inflation from May onwards<br />
(3) explosive phase (March 2009–April 2009)  &#8211; inflation signal is reversed<br />
(4) effusive phase (April 2009–June 2009) &#8211; continued deflation<br />
Deformation during the precursory phase is consistent with inflation of a deep magmatic source modelled as a Mogi source with volume increase of ~0.1 km and depth of ~22 km<span style=""color: rgb(0.000000%, 0.000000%, 100.000000%);"">. </span>During the explosive and effusive phases, deformation is attributed to a shallower, mid-crustal source. In the explosive phase, the best-fit deflation source is a prolate spheroid centered at ~9 km depth with a volume change of ~- 0.05 km³. During the effusive phase, the best-fit deflation source is a Mogi source at a depth of ~9 km with a volume change of ~-0.003 km³ (Cervelli et al., 2009; Grapenthin et al., 2012).</p>
<div class=""column"">
InSAR observations between 2000 and 2010 reveal no consistent or long term deformation at Redoubt. However, the lack of deformation in InSAR observations from the 2009 eruption of Redoubt may be due to a lack of coherent InSAR images (Lu and Dzurisin, 2014).

InSAR measurements of lava flows extruded between 2000 and 2009 were able to estimate a maximum flow thickness of 140 m and a maximum flow subsidence rate of 10 cm/yr at the thickest part of the flows (<em>Ebmeier et al., 2012</em>).<br />

Multiple measurements of surface deformation between 1992 and 2010 have confirmed a slow subsidence signal in the southwest region of Nea Kameni. The location and velocity of this signal remained relatively stable throughout this period, with an observed average subsidence rate on the order of 5 to 6 mm/yr (Parks et al., 2015 and references therein).</span><br />
<span style=""color: #333333;"">Parks et al. (2015) use a 20 year record of InSAR and GPS measurements, with measurements spanning a phase of quiescence and slow subsidence (1993–2010), followed by a phase of unrest (January 2011 to April 2012) with caldera-wide inflation and seismicity. </span><br />
<span style=""color: #333333;"">Mean InSAR velocity maps from 1993–2010 from Parks et al. (2015) indicate an average subsidence rate of ~6 mm/yr over the southern half of the intracaldera island Nea Kameni. This subsidence is due to a combination of thermal contraction of the 1866–1870 lava flows and load-induced relaxation of the substrate. </span><br />
<span style=""color: #333333;"">For the period of unrest,  the location of the inflating source is situated north of Nea Kameni at a depth of ~4 km.

1008,1018,"<p>There are two centers of deformation on Seguam island. The caldera on the western half of the island is characterised by a constant subsidence rate of 1.5 cm/yr. Deformation on the eastern half of the island is variable in time alternating between periods of uplift and subsidence. During 1993, coeruptive interferograms show uplift at a rate of ~5 cm/yr. Subsidence then occurred between late 1993 &#8211; late 2008 at a rate of ~1.6 cm/yr. Until September 2000, uplift resumed at an average rate of ~2 cm/yr. Between September 2000 and July 2005, the volcano again subsided at ~1.4 cm/yr and finally from July 2005 &#8211; 2007, the volcano uplifted at ~0.8 cm/yr.<br />
Both the eastern and western sources are modelled as point sources. In the west, the source is located at at ~2 km depth and volume decrease occurs at a rate of 0.0001 km³/yr. This subsidence is attributed to thermoelastic contraction of young lava flows plus cooling and degassing of magma stored beneath the caldera. Deformation in the east is thought to involve a persistent subsidence source located at ~2 km depth (volume change 0.0001 &#8211; 0.0002 km³/yr) plus an episodic uplift source at ~5.5 km depth (volume change 0.001 &#8211; 0.003 km³/yr). This uplift component is interpreted to be an upper crustal magma reservoir that is episodically replenished. Cooling and degassing of magma in the shallow part of the reservoir then contributes to localised subsidence of the caldera between intrusions such that when intrusion rate is low, the net displacement is downward.</p>

1026,4351,"<p>Sierra Negra, exhibited spatially and temporally variable deformation, with a maximum uplift of 2.7 m between 1992 and 1999, which can be modelled by a shallow inflating sill. Sierra Negra experienced particularly dramatic and variable ground deformation. A peak radar line-of-sight (LOS) displacement (range decrease) of 2.2 m between 1992 and 1998 (corresponding to 2.4 m of uplift; see <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/35039604#f1"">Fig. 1</a>) and 0.3 m during the September 1998 to March 1999 period. The corresponding displacement rates vary from 0.32 m yr<sup>-1</sup> during 1992–97, to 0.90 m yr<sup>-1</sup> during 1997–98, and 0.65 m yr<sup>-1</sup> during 1998–99. Ref 1.<br />
The results of geodetic monitoring since 2002 at Sierra Negra volcano in the Galápagos Islands show that the filling and pressurization of an ∼2-km-deep sill eventually led to an eruption that began on 22 October 2005. Continuous global positioning system (CGPS) monitoring measured &gt;2 m of accelerating inflation leading up to the eruption and contributed to nearly 5 m of total uplift since 1992, the largest precursory inflation ever recorded at a basaltic caldera. Ref 2.<br />
Both InSAR and GPS data document a remarkable story of ~ 5 m pre-eruption uplift during 1992–2005, which was accompanied by at least three trapdoor faulting events on an intra-caldera fault system, in January 1998, April 2005, and just before the eruption in October 2005. The pattern of uplift observed in the InSAR data from different time periods during 1992–2005 is consistent with filling and pressurization of a 2.2 km deep sill under the caldera. Ref 3</p>

1034,3565,"<p>The ongoing eruptions of Mount Sinabung, the first of which occurred in August 2010 and the most recent of which began in September 2013, precipitated several analyses of observational data preceding and immediately following the initial event. Many of these studies utilise ALOS InSAR data, such as the 2012 paper by Chaussard &amp; Amelung, which involved an InSAR survey conducted over the West Sunda Arc, covering 400,000km<sup>2</sup> between mid-2006 and mid-2009. This study noted an unsteady inflation of 3-8cm/yr during this period, with the peak uplift (8cm) occurring between 2007-2008. The source was determined to be a shallow magma reservoir, at a depth of approximately 0.9km below sea level. The same study noted similar patterns of inflation at two other Sumatran volcanoes, Kerinci and Slamet, both of which also erupted within 0.3-2 years of the end of the study period, prompting the authors to conclude that inflation may be a common precursor to eruptive activity in this region.<br />
A second InSAR-based study, conducted by Lee et al and using ALOS data from February 2007 &#8211; January 2011, also recognised a period of inflation preceding the 2010 eruption, though this study estimated a much lower rate of inflation at ~1.7cm/yr, which increased greatly in the sixth months prior to the eruption to an estimated 6.6cm/yr. Lee et al noted that the inflation was largely confined to the summit of the volcano, but agreed with Chaussard &amp; Amelung in that the rate of inflation fluctuated significantly over the course of the study.<br />
Between the conclusion of the eruption, which ended in September 2010, and January 2011, Lee et al observed a steady period of deflation at the volcano summit, totalling around 3cm. The average volumetric change during the entire period was approximated to have ranged from -2.7×10-5 to 1.9×10-6 km3/yr. The study concurs with Chaussard &amp; Amelung that the magmatic source of the deformation was likely to have been shallow, at a depth of between 0.3-1.3km.<br />
Continuous GPS data has also been employed at the volcano; a study by Kriswati et al used data collected between March 2011 and October 2013 to identify a period of horizontal displacement at Sinabung between June and October 2013, on the order of 8-11.3mm. This study identified continued inflation at the volcano following the first explosions of the September 2013 eruption, and observes that displacement increases significantly after June of that year. The authors link this to a Mw6.1 earthquake which occurred in the region on 2nd July 2013, suggesting that this event may have affected the magma reservoir, triggering the increased deformation and possibly the eruption itself.</p>

1036,3554,"<p>Two separate studies (Chaussard et al, 2013; Gonzalez et al, 2015) have utilised ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite) data to perform InSAR studies on the regions surrounding the Singkut caldera. While neither study was centred on Singkut, focusing instead on the nearby Sinabung and Toba edifices, both noted a small amount of deformation at Sibayak, a stratovolcanic cone of Singkut.<br />
Chaussard et al performed their study using data acquired between February 2007 and January 2011, and noted that the observed deformation at Sibayak was &#8216;not significant&#8217;, totalling less than 2cm in small cycles of uplift and subsidence over the four years. This deformation was deemed negligible enough that the measurements were used as a baseline against which more significant deformation at Mt Sinabung might be measured.<br />
The findings of the 2015 Gonzalez et al study (January 2007 &#8211; August 2010) corroborated these measurements, but also noted a poorly defined area of subsidence centred around Mt Sibayak, which the authors suggested could be caused by active degassing processes. The average subsidence at the caldera was estimated at approximately 10 mm/yr, at a relatively constant rate.<br />

Both surveys noted significant deformation at the volcano during the study periods; over the three years of observation, Chaussard &amp; Amelung recorded a total uplift of 12.2cm at the volcanic edifice, at the relatively constant rate of 6.8cm/yr. However, the rate of deformation tapered significantly between early-mid June 2009, during which time Slamet experienced a series of small explosive eruptions.<br />
Philibosian &amp; Simons&#8217; results corroborate these observations, though their measurement of net uplift at the volcano is slightly smaller than that of Chaussard &amp; Amelung &#8211; approximately 5cm of displacement over the two year period (2007-2008), at a greatly reduced rate of 3cm/yr.<br />
Both studies agree that the deformation at Slamet was magmatic in origin, and almost certainly linked to the 2009 eruptions. Philibosian &amp; Simons estimate that their observed deformation signals are most accurately modelled by an injection of magma into a shallow source of approximately 1.5km depth, amounting to a volume increase of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>3</sup>.</p>

Deformation on multiple timescales. Modelling of continuous and campaign GPS gives two magmatic sources at ~ 6 km and ~ 10 km depth (Matiolli et al. 1998, Matiolli et al. 2010). The 6 km source is best modelled as a point source coupled to a NW trending vertical dyke. The 10 km deep source is better modelled as a prolate ellipsoid with volume ~ 24-32 km<sup>^3</sup>. Both sources inflate during periods of repose, and deflate during periods of lava dome growth on 2-3 year timescales. The NW trending dyke causes inflation and deflation on 5-7 week timescales. Summit tiltmeter stations recorded rapid (hourly-daily) cycles inferred to be associated with shallow (&lt; 1 km) conduit processes (e.g. Voight et al. 1998). InSAR observations also show subsidence of pyroclastic flow deposits at a rate of 150-200 mm/year (Wadge et al. 2006).<br />

1065,472,"<p style=""color: #333333;"">In 1972 several baseline distance measurements were made at St Helens, but these were not repeated prior to the onset of activity in 1980. Deformation measurements throughout the eruption were made using EDM, dry-tilt, photogrammetry and tiltmeters. At the peak of activity, photogrammetry revealed over 100 m of deformation on the upper north slope, and continual lateral displacements at 2.5 m/day. Following the eruption, tilt data showed slow deflation interupted by brief periods of inflation that preceeded pyroclastic flows (Lipman and Mullineaux, 1981).</p>
<p style=""color: #333333;"">The first continuous GPS instrument was installed at St Helens in 1997 and in 2000 the U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) established a campaign GPS network of over 40 stations. Repeat measurements of this network were made in 2003 but showed no evidence of volcano-wide deformation. This is in agreement with InSAR studies between 1992 &#8211; 2004, which also showed no measureable deformation (Sherrod et al. 2008).</p>
<p style=""color: #333333;"">In 2004 a swarm of earthquakes marked the onset of renewed unrest at the volcano, and the continuous GPS station recorded motion downwards and inwards. In response to this, the campaign network was resurveyed and 11 new continuous GPS receivers were installed. All instruments recorded subtle (max 3 cm) but widespread deflation of the volcano.  InSAR observations of the eruption were dominated by atmospheric artefacts, but interferograms support subsidence of the edifice at up to 1 cm/yr. Inward and downward movement is interpreted to be due to depletion of a ~7 km depth magma reservoir. Following the eruption there was a slight reversal in the deformation signal (inflation) of up to 1 cm, interpreted to be due to repressurisation of the reservoir (Sherrod et al. 2008).</p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Throughout the eruption, GPS &#8220;spiders&#8221; were developed and deployed by the CVO </span><span style=""color: #333333;"">to record </span><span style=""color: #333333;"">deformation</span><span style=""color: #333333;""> associated with </span><span style=""color: #333333;"">lava</span><span style=""color: #333333;"">dome</span><span style=""color: #333333;""> growth. These instruments were dropped from a helicopter onto the erupted spines providing direct measurements of the extrusion rate. During the eruption a network of tiltmeters was also installed . Instruments close to the vent recorded thousands of events typically consisting of rapid tilt of the ground away from the vent followed by a gradual reversal. This is consistent with slow extrusion of a plug of lava caused by </span>cycles of pressurization within the volcanic conduit near the shallow (&lt; 1 km deep) interface between the rising plug and the 1980s lava dome (Anderson et al. 2010). The tilt events ceased when the eruption ended in late January 2008.<br />
In recent years, additional continuous GPS stations have been installed and in 2013 25 were operational (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/gps/Pacific_Northwest/). Measurements of part of the campaign GPS network also continue (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/gps/Helens/).</p>

1105,3790,"<p>Uplift was first observed at Tangkubanparahu (also called Tangkuban Perahu) by Dvorak et al between 1981 and 1986. Their study used tiltmeter (spirit level) measurements positioned around the edges of the summit craters, and from 1981-1983 they noted an average tilt rate of 40-50 micro-radians per year. This uplift decreased by a factor of five following the onset of phreatic activity at the volcano in 1983; between 1981 and 1983 the approximate volume of uplift was 3 million m3 per year, while from 1984 to 1986 it was 0.4 million m3 per year. The authors therefore link the deformation to the eruptive activity, suggesting possible causes as increased pressure within a very shallow magma body, or heating and expansion of a confined aquifer.<br />
Tangkubanparahu was also included in a 2008-2011 InSAR survey performed by Salvi et al, published in 2015. This study utilised a combination of SBAS InSAR technique (using ALOS-1 data) and Persistent Scatter Interferometry (PSI) to build a large-scale database of deformation covering the entire Bandung basin and some of the surrounding regions, including Tangkubanparahu to the north.

1122,1291,"<p>A 17-benchmark geodetic network was set up in 1982, located in the southern part of the caldera. The network was used to conduct triangulation, trilateration and levelling profiles. No displacements were found from 1982 to 2000 during the observation of both the geodetic network and levelling profile (M.J. Sevilla, 2002, personal communication with Fernández).<br />
InSAR 1992 &#8211; 2000 (Fernández et al., 2003): 1) No deformation took place in the Las Cañadas caldera between 1993 and 2000, in agreement with other geodetic data; and 2) two localised areas of subsidence on the volcano flanks located in the region where the most recent eruptions occurred (Montaña Negra 1706, Chahorra 1798, Chinyero 1909): Garachico and Chı́o deformations. Garachico subsided by ~10cm over this period, extending over 15 km<sup>2. </sup>Chı́o subsided by 3 cm, extending over 8 km<sup>2</sup>.GPS 2000 (Fernández et al., 2003): A GPS network was set up, using the previous network locations, and observed from 5 to 12 August 2000. The GPS results largely confirm the InSAR results. InSAR data, coupled with GPS, between 1992 to 2005 reveal (Fernández et al., 2009): 1) three distinct small areas of high subsidence located outside the caldera at the NW and NE rifts; 2) a lower subsidence area in the south rift ; (iii) a large-scale deformation pattern following the outline of the island, extending well beyond caldera rim. The shape and position of this signal coincides with the extent of the dense core of the island (Fernández et al., 2009).<br />
The signals associated with 1 and 2 are in areas characterized by less-dense or more-fracturated material relatively to the surroundings. Thus Fernández et al. (2009) interpret deformation is due to water table variations, interaction with existing fractures or to seismo-volcanic unrest. The large-scale deformation is interpreted to be related to gravitational sinking of the dense core of the island into a weak lithosphere.</p>

In response to this, the tilt-leveling and EDM networks were resurveyed using GPS, and measurements showed uplift at rates consistent with InSAR (Dzurisin et al. 2006). In 2002 &#8211; 2003, new leveling lines and 30 new campaign GPS marks were added (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/gps/Sisters/). Three continuous GPS stations were also installed between 2001 and 2004 (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/gps/Pacific_Northwest/). Continuous GPS measurements, and additional InSAR measurements between 2004 and 2006, showed that the deformation rate had decreased to ~1.4 cm/yr (Dzurisin et al. 2007). InSAR timeseries show that this decreased rate of uplift continued until at least 2010 (Riddick and Schmidt, 2011). Geochemical anomalies that coincide with the area of uplift suggest the existence of magma in the crust, and uplift is interpreted as inflation caused by magma intrusion (Wicks et al. 2002). In total ~0.05 &#8211; 0.07 km³ of magma was intruded as of Autunmn 2010 (Riddick and Schmidt, 2011), with models for all datasets suggesting a source depth of 5 &#8211; 7 km.</p>

1142,3569,"<p>Evidence from a 2015 paper by de Silva et al suggests that Toba has been uplifting in an unsteady, episodic manner since approximately 33.7ky. This study utilised the variations in <sup>14</sup>C values of lake sediments deposited on the slopes of certain islands within the Toba crater lake. Through this method, the authors estimated that Samosir island has since experienced ~700m of uplift in the east, while the deformation in the west has been much less pronounced. A more in-depth analysis of the stratigraphy suggested that uplift rates were highest between 33.7-22.5 ka at 4.9 cm/yr, but have since diminished to less than 0.7 cm/yr from 22.5ka onwards. Combining these figures with numerical models suggests that the deformation is more likely to be caused by intrusion of new material beneath the caldera, than by relaxation as a cause of caldera collapse, as was proposed by Chesner &amp; Rose, 1991. This inference of continued magmatic activity since the caldera collapse at ~74ky is supported by ongoing hydrothermal and fumarolic activities observed at the volcano.</p>

Between 1992 &#8211; 2000, uplift of 5–10 mm/yr was observed, and inspection of individual interferograms suggests that most deformation occurred during 1997–2000. Between 2000 &#8211; 2004, averaged deformation images show that the inflation near Martin, Mageik and Trident continued at 4–7 mm/year, slightly lower than the results for 1997–2000. This inflation has been modelled using a spheroid and sill source to account for the elongate shape of the deformation field. The source location is constrained to the summit and eastern flank of Mageik, with dimensions ranging between 10 &#8211; 20 km and depths ranging from 5 &#8211; 15 km. The average rate of volume increase since 1995 is 0.008 km³/yr. The inflation pattern is consistent with gravity surveys of the area which reveal a low density gravity anomaly in the region. These observations suggest the presence of a crustal magma body that is probably responsible for the inflation signal.</p>

1195,4036,"<p>Though not the direct subject of the study, Ungaran volcano was included in Kuehn et al&#8217;s land subsidence survey of the city of Semarang in Sumatra. This study used the Stable Points Network (SPN) technique to measure ground displacement &#8211; the SPN technique is a relatively modern synthetic aperture radar-based method, which utilises backscattering objects on the ground surface to measure displacement with millimetre-scale accuracy. The survey was performed using images acquired between 2002 and 2006, and covers an area of approximately 375km<sup>2</sup>.<br />
Over the four years of observation, the northeastern flank of Ungaran exhibited significant subsidence, at a rate of approximately 1cm/yr. The deformation increases with distance from the volcanic edifice, and takes the form of a roughly cylindrical depression. A comparison with geological surveys of the area confirms the presence of a collapse ring fault structure, to which the authors attribute the ground displacement.</p>

1272,1227,"<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Between 1923 &#8211; 1985, ~60 cm of uplift was measured at Yellowstone, including ~18 cm of ground deformation measured by leveling between 1976 &#8211; 1984. This was followed by a shorter period of subsidence (1985 &#8211; 1992) with displacements of ~14 cm. Up until this time </span><span style=""color: #333333;"">it was thought that all ground deformation occurred all in the central part of the Yellowstone </span><span style=""color: #333333;"">caldera. However, between 1997 &#8211; 2003, </span>12-13 cm of uplift occurred in a different region measuring ~35 x 40 km centered on the northern caldera rim. Outside of this region subsidence of up to 4 cm was recorded. Since this time, ground deformation has refturned to the central part of the caldera. Between 2004 &#8211; 2006, GPS and InSAR data show that Yellowstone uplifted by up to 7 cm/yr, with total displacements of 17 cm. Models of this deformation episode infer magma intruded ~10 km beneath the caldera. This magma input is thought to have fractured the crust, releasing hydrothermal fluids and resulting in subsidence of the region to the north, which had previously uplifted. Further analysis of GPS data between 2004 &#8211; 2010 reveal horizontal extension of up to 0.7 cm beneath Yellowstone lake. Using evidence from borehole strainmeters, it is estimated that magma is present 3 &#8211; 6 km beneath the surface of Yellowstone and that the magma is partially molten.<br />
The first GPS measurements at Yellowstone were made in 1987. By January 2006 there were 12 GPS receivers operating at Yellowstone. Data from the Yellowstone-Snake-River-Plain GPS network can be found at the University of Utah (http://www.uusatrg.utah.edu/ts_ysrp.html).<br />
Deformation at Yellowstone is thought to be driven by both magmatic and hydrothermal sources. Cycles of uplift and subsidence have been attributed to hydrothermal systems. As pressure within the hydrothermal system increases, the reservoir eventually fails and trapped magmatic fluids escape. This causes the hydrothermal system to depressurise, and the overburden subsides. Once the ruptured zone reseals, the hydrothermal system repressurises and the cycle begins again.<br />
<span class=""current-selection"" style=""color: #000000;"">It has also been proposed that the observed patterns of uplift and subsidence at Yellowstone results from variations in the movement of molten basalt in to and out of the volcanic system. As the flux of magma increases, uplift occurs. As the flux decreases, subsidence occurs. Subsidence could also be controlled by cooling or fluid loss from the magma.</span></p>
